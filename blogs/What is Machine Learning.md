<h1>What is Machine Learning</h1>

<p>The scientific field of machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence, as defined by Computer Scientist and machine learning pioneer [1] Tom M. Mitchell: “Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience.”
An algorithm can be thought of as a set of rules/instructions that a computer programmer specifies, which a computer can process. Simply put, machine learning algorithms learn by experience, similar to how humans do. For example, after having seen multiple examples of an object, a compute-employing machine learning algorithm can become able to recognize that object in new, previously unseen scenarios.

How does machine learning work?
</h2>

<p>In practice, the patterns that a computer (machine learning system) learns can be very complicated and difficult to explain. Consider searching for dog images on Google search — as seen in the image below, Google is incredibly good at bringing relevant results, yet how does Google search achieve this task? In simple terms, Google search first gets a large number of examples (image dataset) of photos labeled “dog” — then the computer (machine learning system) looks for patterns of pixels and patterns of colors that help it guess (predict) if the image queried it is indeed a dog.
</p>
<p>At first, Google’s computer makes a random guess of what patterns are reasonable to identify a dog's image. If it makes a mistake, then a set of adjustments are made for the computer to get it right. In the end, such collection of patterns learned by a large computer system modeled after the human brain (deep neural network), that once is trained, can correctly identify and bring accurate results of dog images on Google search, along with anything else that you could think of — such process is called the training phase of a machine learning system.

<h2>Why is machine learning important?</h2>
<p>Machine learning its incredibly important nowadays. First, because it can solve complicated real-world problems in a scalable way, second, because it has disrupted a variety of industries within the past decade [9], and continues to do so in the future, as more and more industry leaders and researchers are specializing in machine learning, along taking what they have learned to continue with their research and/or develop machine learning tools to impact their own fields positively. Third, artificial intelligence has the potential to incrementally add 16% or around $ 13 trillion to the US economy by 2030. The rate in which machine learning is causing positive impact is already surprisingly impressive, which have been successful thanks to the dramatic change in data storage and computing processing power — as more people are increasingly becoming involved, we can only expect it to continue with this route and continue to cause amazing progress in different fields.</p>
